# Text-Editor

## Description
Using starter code this project allowed me to create a web text editor where the user can create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection and where the user can reliably retrieve them for later use. This application will use the data in the indexedDB to populate the editor but if that cannot be accessed it will use local storage. This project allowed me to gain an understanding how using a integrated service worker and Cache API's to ensure that the application will remain fully functional even without and active internet connection.
